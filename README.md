I am going to build a basic recipe website

But first I will set up the project to GitHub

Steps from GitHub.com:
1. The + sign and select New repository
2. Name the project and select Add a Readme file
3. Select - Create Repository
4. Click Code, Select SSH and copy the address

Create a folder in the pc and move to it
That Repo that we create in Github will be used here
* Move the repo
1. CD to the folder we are going to work in the terminal
2. use the command - git clone "paste the address we copied in Github" and press Enter
3. It will create a folder with the name we gave the project in Github
4. We cd into that folder

////We will be using the README.md file to leave notes///
* git staus - to check if the filed is staged
* If showing in red it is not staged
* git add - will add the file to the staging area
* Will show the file in green after using git status again
* git commit -m "the name of the file" will commit the changes


create moe page and other to do links
