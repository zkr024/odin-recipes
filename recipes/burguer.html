        <h3>This is a great hamburger for the grill. Feta cheese gives it a rich and creamy taste.</h3>
        
        <p>A hamburger (or burger for short) is a food, typically considered a sandwich, consisting of one or more cooked patties, usually ground meat, typically beef—placed inside a sliced bread roll or bun.</p>
        <p>patty may be pan fried, grilled, smoked or flame broiled. Hamburgers are often served with cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, bacon, or chilis; condiments such as ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, relish, or a "special sauce", often a variation of Thousand Island dressing; and are frequently placed on sesame seed buns. A hamburger topped with cheese is called a cheeseburger.</p>
    
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon dried parsley</li>
                <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
                <li>1 cup crumbled feta cheese</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat, and lightly oil the grate.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Knead together the ground beef, Worcestershire sauce, parsley, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Form the mixture into 8 equal-sized balls; flatten to make thin patties. Place about 1/4 cup of feta cheese onto each of four of the patties. Top each of the patties with cheese with one of the patties without; press the edges together to seal the cheese into the center.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Cook on the preheated grill until the burgers are cooked to your desired degree of doneness, 7 to 8 minutes per side for well done. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
