    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Heat 1/4 cup oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in 
                    chopped onions and bay leaf; cook and stir until the onion 
                    has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Add 2 
                    cloves minced garlic, oregano, and 2 teaspoons basil; cook and 
                    stir for 2 more minutes.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Mix in undrained crushed tomatoes and diced tomatoes. Bring to 
                    a boil, reduce heat, and simmer for 1 hour. Stir in cinnamon 
                    and set pan aside.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 
                    9x13-inch baking dish.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Bring a large pot of salted water to boil, add lasagna noodles 
                    and bring water to boil again. Cook until noodles are al dente. 
                    Drain well.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Mix together ricotta, eggs, 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, 2 teaspoons 
                    basil, and 1 clove minced garlic.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Saute sliced onion and mushrooms in 2 tablespoons olive oil 
                    until tender, about 5 minutes. Add spinach and zucchini to the 
                    skillet. Cover, and cook until spinach is wilted, 2 to 5 minutes.
                    Remove skillet from heat and set aside.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Spread 1/2 cup of the tomato sauce in the prepared baking dish. 
                    Place a layer of noodles on top of the tomato sauce; spread 
                    all of the ricotta mixture onto the noodles. Place another 
                    layer of noodles on top of the ricotta mixture.                
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Pour about 2 cups tomato sauce onto the noodles; arrange all of 
                    the sauteed vegetables on top of the sauce. Top vegetables with 
                    noodles and spread the remaining tomato sauce over the final layer 
                    of noodles. Top with mozzarella cheese slices and 1 cup grated 
                    Parmesan cheese.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Bake the lasagna in the preheated oven until filling is bubbly 
                    and cheese is melted and beginning to brown, 45 minutes to 1 
                    hour. Remove the lasagna from the oven and let it cool 10 
                    minutes before serving.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
